- [Deep neural networks show an equivalent and often superior performance  to dermatologists in onychomycosis diagnosis: Automatic construction of onychomycosis datasets by region-based convolutional deep neural network (PLOS One) (Han and Park et. al., Jan 2018)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191493)
	- AI ensemble model performs better than 42 dermatologists at diagnosing a skin disorder based on images
	- Model: Ensemble model: ResNet-152+VGG-19 + feedforward neural networks, 
	- Data: trained using a dataset of standardised nail images comprising 49k images created using a R-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) trained to distinguish the nail from the background
	- 'The CNNs....and the smartphone platform we developed .May be useful for telemedicine where the access to dermatologists is unavailable.'
